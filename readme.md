# Foam cutting tools

## Getting Started
These programs are for a hotwire cutter, which consist of two moving carriages and a steel wire
between them. Four stepper motors move the carriages of the hotwire. As an output you can get
a foam wing blank cut out of a foam block.

This project consist of windows uwp programs **styroXcut and styroXjog** and arduino program
**runsteppers.ino**. Windows programs are also available in microsoft store if you want
to install them without compiling.

### Prerequisites
You need a windows machine, **arduino uno** and **cnc shield** for it.
Connect stepper motors and suitable power input to your cnc-shield. 
Install arduino windows driver, connect usb cable between windows machine and arduino.

### Installing
With arduino ide, send **runsteppers.ino** to arduino. Load styroXjog from microsoft
store and connect and run.
